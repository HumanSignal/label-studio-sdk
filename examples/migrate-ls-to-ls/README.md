# Migrate from one Label Studio instance to another 

This migration helps to copy projects from one LS instance to another.
* Users,
* Projects,
* Tasks and
* Annotations
will be copied, other entities are not supported. Storages are not yet supported.

Each new run of this script will generate new projects on the destination instance.

# How it works? 

1. Get all projects from source LS (or specific projects)
2. Get all users from these projects
3. Create all users with the same emails, first names and last names on the target LS instance 
4. For each project run

    4.1. export on the source LS instance, wait until export is done
    > Note: if there is an export error, skip this project
    
    4.2. create a new projects on the target LS instance with the same params as on source instance, except review settings and assignment settings (enterprise only) 
    > Note: Cloud storages, ML backends, Members, Webhooks are not copied. Data manager and other advanced things are not copied too
 
    4.3. import **tasks** and **annotations** from the exported file
 
    4.4. write old project id => new project id mapping to `project_mapping.json` in the directory where you run the migration script.  

# Usage

1. Install Label Studio SDK:

    ```
    pip install -U label-studio-sdk
    ```

2. Go to source (src) and target (dst) LS instances. Open Account pages (/user/account), copy your Access tokens. 

    > **Attention**: Be careful not to mix up the tokens, otherwise you have a change to create a big mess of projects and users. 

    > Note: User token must have Administrator or Owner privileges.

3. Migrate all projects from the organization:

    ```bash
    python3 migrate-ls-to-ls.py --src-url http://localhost:8000 --src-key <src-token> --dst-url https://app.heartex.com --dst-key <dst-token>
    ```
    
    Or migrate specific projects only:
    
    ```bash
    python3 migrate-ls-to-ls.py --src-url http://localhost:8000 --src-key <src-token> --dst-url https://app.heartex.com --dst-key <dst-token> --project-ids=123,456
    ```
