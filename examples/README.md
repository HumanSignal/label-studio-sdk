These end-to-end examples demonstrate how to use the SDK for specific use cases.

### Active learning example

If you want to write a Python script to set up an active learning workflow for labeling and training, review this [working active learning example as a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/examples/active_learning/active_learning.ipynb) or start with the [active learning python script example](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/examples/active_learning/active_learning.py).

### Weak supervision example

If you want to write a Python script to perform programmatic labeling and use weak supervision to correct the noisy labels, refer to this [working weak supervision example as a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/examples/weak_supervision/weak_supervision.ipynb) or start with the [weak supervision python script example](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/examples/weak_supervision/weak_supervision.py).
