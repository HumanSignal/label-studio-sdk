        Retrieve the members for a specific project.

        **Response Fields:**
        - `implicit_member` (boolean): Indicates if the user is an implicit member.
          - `true`: User has access via workspace membership or organization role (Administrator/Owner)
          - `false`: User is an explicit project member (added directly to the project)
        - `project_role` (string|null): Project-specific role override if assigned, null otherwise

        **Note:** Users can have both explicit membership AND implicit access. The `implicit_member` field is `false` if the user has an explicit ProjectMember entry, regardless of whether they also have implicit access via workspace or org role.

        Parameters
        ----------
        id : int

        ids : typing.Optional[str]
            Comma-separated list of user IDs to filter by

        implicit : typing.Optional[bool]
            Include/Exclude implicit project members in the results. If not provided, explicit + implicit members are returned.

        last_activity_gte : typing.Optional[dt.datetime]
            Filter by last activity time (ISO 8601 datetime). Returns users with last activity greater than or equal to this time.

        last_activity_lte : typing.Optional[dt.datetime]
            Filter by last activity time (ISO 8601 datetime). Returns users with last activity less than or equal to this time.

        no_annotators : typing.Optional[bool]
            Exclude annotators from the results

        ordering : typing.Optional[str]
            Ordering field. Prefix with "-" for descending order. Allowed fields: id, email, first_name, last_name, username, last_activity, role, date_joined

            **Note on role ordering:**
            When ordering by "role", the system uses the effective role:
            - Project-specific role if assigned (takes precedence)
            - Organization role if no project role is assigned

            Roles are sorted alphabetically by their code: AD (Administrator), AN (Annotator), DI (Disabled), MA (Manager), NO (Not Activated), OW (Owner), RE (Reviewer)

        page : typing.Optional[int]
            A page number within the paginated result set.

        page_size : typing.Optional[int]
            Number of results to return per page.

        role : typing.Optional[str]
            Filter members by role. Accepts single role or comma-separated list of roles.

            **Format:**
            - Single role: `?role=RE`
            - Multiple roles: `?role=AN,RE` (users with ANY of these roles)

            **Role Codes:**
            - `OW` = Owner
            - `AD` = Administrator
            - `MA` = Manager
            - `RE` = Reviewer
            - `AN` = Annotator

            **Matching Logic:**
            Returns users who have any of the specified roles either:
            1. As their **project-specific role** (from project role assignments), OR
            2. As their **organization role** (if they have no project-specific role override)

            **Note:** Project-specific roles take precedence. If a user has a project role assigned, their organization role is ignored for filtering purposes.

        search : typing.Optional[str]
            Search term for filtering members by name, email, or username

        with_deleted : typing.Optional[bool]
            Include deleted members in the results

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        SyncPager[PaginatedProjectMember, PaginatedPaginatedProjectMemberList]
