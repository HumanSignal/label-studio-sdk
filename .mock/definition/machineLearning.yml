                Create predictions for all tasks using a specific ML backend so that you can set up an active learning strategy
                based on the confidence or uncertainty scores associated with the predictions. Creating predictions requires 
                a Label Studio ML backend set up and configured for your project. 

                See [Set up machine learning](https://labelstud.io/guide/ml.html) for more details 
                about a Label Studio ML backend.

                Reference the ML backend ID in the path of this API call. Get the ML backend ID by 
                [listing the ML backends for a project](https://labelstud.io/api/#operation/api_ml_list).
