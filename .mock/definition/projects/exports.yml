        snapshots, this easy export endpoint might have timeouts.</Note>

        Export annotated tasks as a file in a specific format.

        For example, to export JSON annotations for a project to a file called
        `annotations.json`,

        run the following from the command line:

        ```bash

        curl -X GET
        https://localhost:8080/api/projects/{id}/export?exportType=JSON -H
        'Authorization: Token abc123' --output 'annotations.json'

        ```

        To export all tasks, including skipped tasks and others without
        annotations, run the following from the command line:

        ```bash

        curl -X GET
        https://localhost:8080/api/projects/{id}/export?exportType=JSON&download_all_tasks=true
        -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' --output 'annotations.json'

        ```

        To export specific tasks with IDs of 123 and 345, run the following from
        the command line:

        ```bash

        curl -X GET
        https://localhost:8080/api/projects/{id}/export?ids[]=123\&ids[]=345 -H
        'Authorization: Token abc123' --output 'annotations.json'

        ```


        You must provide a project ID. The project ID can be found in the URL

        Create a new export request to start a background task and generate an
        export file (snapshot) for a specific project by ID. The project ID can
        be found in the URL when viewing the project in Label Studio, or you can
        retrieve all project IDs using [List all projects](../list). 


        A snapshot is a static export of your project's data and annotations at
        a specific point in time. It captures the current state of your tasks,
        annotations, and other relevant data, allowing you to download and
        review them later. Snapshots are particularly useful for large projects
        as they help avoid timeouts during export operations by processing the
        data asynchronously.


        For more information, see the [Label Studio documentation on exporting
        annotations](https://labelstud.io/guide/export.html).
