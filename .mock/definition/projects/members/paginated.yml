        Retrieve the members for a specific project.


        **Response Fields:**

        - `implicit_member` (boolean): Indicates if the user is an implicit
        member.
          - `true`: User has access via workspace membership or organization role (Administrator/Owner)
          - `false`: User is an explicit project member (added directly to the project)
        - `project_role` (string|null): Project-specific role override if
        assigned, null otherwise


        **Note:** Users can have both explicit membership AND implicit access.
        The `implicit_member` field is `false` if the user has an explicit
        ProjectMember entry, regardless of whether they also have implicit
        access via workspace or org role.

            type: optional<datetime>
            docs: >-
              Filter by last activity time (ISO 8601 datetime). Returns users
              with last activity greater than or equal to this time.

          ordering:
            type: optional<string>
            docs: >-
              Ordering field. Prefix with "-" for descending order. Allowed
              fields: id, email, first_name, last_name, username, last_activity,
              role, date_joined


              **Note on role ordering:**

              When ordering by "role", the system uses the effective role:

              - Project-specific role if assigned (takes precedence)

              - Organization role if no project role is assigned


              Roles are sorted alphabetically by their code: AD (Administrator),
              AN (Annotator), DI (Disabled), MA (Manager), NO (Not Activated),
              OW (Owner), RE (Reviewer)
          page:
            type: optional<integer>
            docs: A page number within the paginated result set.
          page_size:
            type: optional<integer>
            docs: Number of results to return per page.
          role:
            type: optional<string>
            docs: >-
              Filter members by role. Accepts single role or comma-separated
              list of roles.


              **Format:**

              - Single role: `?role=RE`

              - Multiple roles: `?role=AN,RE` (users with ANY of these roles)


              **Role Codes:**

              - `OW` = Owner

              - `AD` = Administrator

              - `MA` = Manager

              - `RE` = Reviewer

              - `AN` = Annotator


              **Matching Logic:**

              Returns users who have any of the specified roles either:

              1. As their **project-specific role** (from project role
              assignments), OR

              2. As their **organization role** (if they have no
              project-specific role override)


              **Note:** Project-specific roles take precedence. If a user has a
              project role assigned, their organization role is ignored for
              filtering purposes.
