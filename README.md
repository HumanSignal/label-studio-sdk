The Label Studio Python Library provides convenient access to the Label Studio API from applications written in Python.

<!-- Outline -->


# Documentation
Explore the Label Studio API documentation [here](https://api.labelstud.io/).


# Installation

```sh
pip install --upgrade label-studio-sdk
# or
poetry add label-studio-sdk
```

# Usage

```python
from label_studio_sdk.client import LabelStudio

ls = LabelStudio(
    base_url='YOUR_LABEL_STUDIO_URL',  
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)
```

# Examples

Check more examples [here](https://api.labelstud.io/).

## Create a new project

```python
from label_studio_sdk.label_interface import LabelInterface
from label_studio_sdk.label_interface.create import labels

project = ls.projects.create(
    name="Project name",
    description="Project description",
    label_config=LabelInterface.create({
      "image": "Image",
      "bbox": labels(["cat", "dog"], tag_type="RectangleLabels")
    })
)
```

## Create a new task
    
```python
task = ls.tasks.create(
    project=project.id,
    data={"image": "https://example.com/image.jpg"}
)
```
Now you can open the project `PROJECT_ID` in the Label Studio UI and create annotations for the task.

## Export annotations

```python
annotations = [
    task.annotations
    for task in ls.tasks.list(project=project.id, fields='all')
    if task.annotations
]
```


## Async client

```python
from label_studio_sdk.client import AsyncLabelStudio

client = AsyncLabelStudio(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)
```

## Advanced

### Timeouts
By default, requests time out after 60 seconds. You can configure this with a 
timeout option at the client or request level.

```python
from label_studio_sdk.client import LabelStudio

ls = LabelStudio(
    # All timeouts set to 20 seconds
    timeout=20.0
)

ls.projects.create(..., {
    # Override timeout for a specific method
    timeout=20.0
})
```

### Custom HTTP client
You can override the httpx client to customize it for your use-case. Some common use-cases 
include support for proxies and transports.

```python
import httpx

from label_studio_sdk.client import LabelStudio

ls = LabelStudio(
    http_client=httpx.Client(
        proxies="http://my.test.proxy.example.com",
        transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(local_address="0.0.0.0"),
    ),
)
```

# Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. 
Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code, 
otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as
 a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening 
an issue first to discuss with us!

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
