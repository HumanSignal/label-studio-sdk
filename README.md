# Versions

## SDK 2.0.0

In August 2025, we released SDK version 2.0.0. 

This version has a number of documentation and functional improvements over SDK 1. 

### Enhancements 

**Enterprise-only**

- Added a new `projects.stats.iaa` endpoint to return stats from the inter-annotator agreement matrix. 
- You can now update tasks that have comments.
- Added support for `sync` to `S3s` (S3 with IAM role) exports.

**Enterprise and open source**

- Expanded support to include all project settings, many of which were missing in SDK 1. For example, in Enterprise environments you can now configure `assignment_settings`, `review_settings`, `annotator_evaluation`, and many more.
- Fixed passing the `project` parameter in `actions.list()` (broken in SDK 1). 
- Relaxed request/response validation reduces pydantic errors in SDK 2.

### Breaking changes

**Enterprise-only**

- `comments.create` no longer accepts a `project` argument.
- In `prompts.indicators`, the `pk` parameter is now `id`.
- In `prompts.runs` and `prompts.versions`, the `id` parameter is now `prompt_id`.
- `workspaces.members.list` responses are now objects instead of dictionaries.

**Enterprise and open source**

- In `projects.exports` calls, the project ID is now passed as `id`, while the export ID is passed as `export_pk`.
- Predictions returned in task responses are now objects instead of dictionaries. 

## SDK 1.0+

SDK 1 was released in June 2024. 

If you use the Label Studio SDK 1 package in any automated pipelines, we strongly recommend pinning your SDK version to `<2.0.0` until you can reconcile the breaking changes. 


## SDK <1

The version of `label-studio-sdk<1` is deprecated and no longer supported. We recommend updating to the latest version.

<details>

<summary> To use SDK <1 </summary>

If you still want to use the deprecated version, you can install it with `pip install "label-studio-sdk<1"`. 

OR You can find the branch with the old version by cloning the repository and checking out the branch as follows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-sdk.git
cd label-studio-sdk
git fetch origin
git checkout release/0.0.34
```

OR you can change your import statements as follows:
```python
from label_studio_sdk import Client
from label_studio_sdk.data_manager import Filters, Column, Operator, Type
from label_studio_sdk._legacy import Project
```

</details>

# Example: Create a new project with tasks

```python
# Import the SDK and the client module
from label_studio_sdk import LabelStudio

client = LabelStudio(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080",   # <-- put your LS URL here
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",             # <-- put your API key here
)

label_config = """
<View>
  <Header value="Choose text sentiment:"/>
  <Text name="text" value="$text"/>
  <Choices name="sentiment" toName="text" choice="single">
    <Choice value="Positive"/>
    <Choice value="Negative"/>
    <Choice value="Neutral"/>
  </Choices>
</View>
"""

# Create project
project = client.projects.create(
    title="Sentiment Classification",
    label_config=label_config
)

# (Optional) validate the config to catch mistakes early
client.projects.validate_label_config(id=project.id, label_config=label_config)

# Create a single task
task = client.tasks.create(
    project=project.id,
    data={"text": "Label Studio is the best!"}  # 'text' matches value="$text"
)
print(f"Created task id: {task.id}")

# Or create multiple tasks at once
client.projects.import_tasks(
    id=project.id,
    request=[
        {"text": "I love Label Studio"},
        {"text": "Label Studio helps me ship faster"},
    ]
)
```

# Contributing

Please follow [this guide to contribute to the SDK](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-client-generator?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-contribute)

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. 
Additions made directly to this library would have to be moved over to our generation code, 
otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as
 a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening 
an issue first to discuss with us!

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
