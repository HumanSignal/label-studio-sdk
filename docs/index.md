# Label Studio SDK

This package provides a set of Python modules and classes that serve as wrappers for common operations that you can perform with the <a href="https://labelstud.io/api/">Label Studio API</a> for <a href="labelstud.io">Label Studio</a> Enterprise, Teams, and Community editions.

- For a quickstart and install guidance, as well as basic examples for using this SDK, see [**the SDK tutorial** in the Label Studio documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/sdk.html).
- To review detailed usage examples, see the [Usage Examples for the Label Studio SDK](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk/tree/master/examples). 
- To see error logs, you can use `stderr` (we use `logger.error()` for error output). If you use console to run SDK commands, you will see all errors there.
